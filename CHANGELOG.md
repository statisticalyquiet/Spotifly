# Changelog

All notable changes to Spotifly will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- Fix connecting to Spotify Connect enabled speakers
- Bug fixes and performance improvements

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- AirPlay audio routing rewritten to use `AVAudioEngine` with a custom `AudioRenderer` for more reliable AirPlay device support
- Spotify Connect session stability improvements: better soft reconnect handling, reduced playback jolts during network recovery
- Use 300px album art instead of 640px across the app — reduces download size and eliminates OS-side JPEG transcode overhead in Now Playing (largest display size is 200pt)

### Fixed
- Mini player mode no longer breaks when a fullscreen notification triggers a window state change
- Significantly reduced CPU usage during playback: split Now Playing metadata updates into full vs position-only paths, lowered seek bar update frequency, stopped unnecessary drift-check writes, and removed redundant per-second `currentPositionMs` updates (~94% reduction in active CPU samples vs 1.2.2)

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Context-aware track playback: double-tap a track in an album, playlist, or favorites to play from that position within the context (thanks [@vitbashy](https://github.com/vitbashy)!)

### Changed
- Adapt to [Spotify Web API breaking changes (February 2026)](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/references/changes/february-2026): migrate removed endpoints, update playlist response structure, and replace batch fetches with parallel individual requests

### Fixed
- Double-tapping a queue track when playing radio (no context URI) no longer silently does nothing — falls back to single track playback
- Clicking a track card in search results before any playback has occurred now properly initializes the player first

### Removed
- Artist top tracks section (endpoint removed by Spotify with no alternative)
- New Releases section (endpoint removed by Spotify with no alternative)
- Artist follower counts, user email/country/follower display (fields removed from API responses)
